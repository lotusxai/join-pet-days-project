#### short story
As a digital nomad traveling with 2 dogs, keeping track of all their medical and vaccine records has been challenging. Especially since one of my dogs has had some recent health issues. I needed a way to keep track of all the vet visits, test results, vaccine certificates, etc. as well as be able to share them with new vets and our home base vet back in Colorado. Thus, an R shiny app was born.

#### setup

```
git clone https://github.com/lotusxai/pet-days.git
cd pet-days/

Rscript run_requirements.R

```
run_requirements.R installs the necessary packages, runs setup_db.R and tests the setup.  
Note: The setup_db.R script contains the view and table creation scripts.

#### running the app

If all the tests pass, the following command launches the shiny app in your browser.

```
R -e "shiny::runApp(launch.browser = TRUE)"
```
